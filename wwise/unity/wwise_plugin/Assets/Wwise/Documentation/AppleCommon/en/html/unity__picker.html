<h1><a class="anchor" id="unity_picker">Wwise Picker </a></h1><p>The Wwise Picker window shows the available objects (such as Events and Switches) from your Wwise project, using the same structure. The project displayed in the Wwise Picker view is the one that is entered in the Wwise Settings window (menu <b>Edit &gt; Wwise Settings...</b>), that was normally specified when the Wwise plug-in was installed in Unity.</p>
<p>The available objects are updated in the Wwise Picker view when the Wwise project is saved. So, if you don't see objects that you created, it is probably because your project wasn't saved. You can force a refresh of the <code>Wwise</code> Picker view by clicking <code>Refresh Project</code>. Note that this also refreshes all Wwise-related data, including data found in the XML metadata files that are created when generating the SoundBanks.</p>
<p>Use the filter box near the top of the Wwise Picker to search for a specific item. Simply write the name of the item you're looking for and the Picker will automatically filter the items that don't match your search. You might need to expand some items if the one you're looking for has a closed parent.</p>
<p>You can expand and close items by clicking on the + and - buttons or by double clicking the item's name.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="generating_soundbanks">
Generating SoundBanks</a></h2>
<p>Click <code>Generate SoundBanks</code> to generate all SoundBanks for all platforms and languages. The generated SoundBanks will appear under the Wwise Picker's SoundBanks folder, the same as if they were generated from within Wwise. Additionally, the Unity status bar will display one of a possible two messages: <code>WwiseUnity: SoundBanks generation successful</code>, if there were no errors or warnings; <code>WwiseUnity: SoundBanks generation has warning(s) </code>, if there were warnings ; and <code>WwiseUnity: SoundBanks generation error</code>, if there were errors. Click on the message to move focus to the <code>Console</code> tab, which displays information from the SoundBank generation process.</p>

Adding audio to your scenes with the Picker</a></h2>
<p>To add any object from the Wwise Picker to your scene, drag the object onto an existing Game Object or into the Inspector window. Refer to each component's documentation for further details about the components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragging and dropping an Event creates an <a class="el" href="class_ak_ambient.html">AkAmbient</a>.</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping a SoundBank creates an <a class="el" href="class_ak_bank.html">AkBank</a>.</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping a Switch Value creates an <a class="el" href="class_ak_switch.html">AkSwitch</a>.</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping a State Value creates an <a class="el" href="class_ak_state.html">AkState</a>.</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an Aux Bus creates an <a class="el" href="class_ak_environment.html">AkEnvironment</a>. </li>
